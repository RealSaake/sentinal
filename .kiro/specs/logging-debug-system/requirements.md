# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities to the Sentinel Storage Analyzer application. The system will provide visibility into application operations, error tracking, performance monitoring, and debugging tools to help diagnose issues like the recent connection problems with the AI backend.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer debugging the application, I want comprehensive logging of all operations, so that I can identify where failures occur and understand the application flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL create a log file with timestamp and initialization status
2. WHEN any AI inference request is made THEN the system SHALL log the request details, response time, and outcome
3. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL log the operation type, affected records, and execution time
4. WHEN file scanning operations run THEN the system SHALL log the directory path, file count, and processing duration
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the full exception details, stack trace, and context information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user experiencing application issues, I want to access debug information through the UI, so that I can troubleshoot problems without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the application settings THEN the system SHALL provide a "Debug Info" section
2. WHEN I click "View Logs" THEN the system SHALL display recent log entries in a readable format
3. WHEN I click "System Status" THEN the system SHALL show AI backend connectivity, database status, and recent operation results
4. WHEN I click "Export Debug Info" THEN the system SHALL create a debug report file with logs and system information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable log levels, so that I can control the verbosity of logging for different scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL support DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL log levels
2. WHEN I change the log level in configuration THEN the system SHALL only output logs at or above that level
3. WHEN in DEBUG mode THEN the system SHALL log detailed request/response data, timing information, and internal state changes
4. WHEN in production mode THEN the system SHALL default to INFO level to balance visibility with performance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want automatic log rotation and cleanup, so that log files don't consume excessive disk space over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN log files exceed 10MB THEN the system SHALL rotate to a new log file
2. WHEN more than 5 log files exist THEN the system SHALL delete the oldest files
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL clean up log files older than 30 days
4. WHEN log rotation occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain continuity without losing current session logs

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance monitoring and metrics, so that I can identify bottlenecks and optimize the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI inference requests are made THEN the system SHALL track response times and success rates
2. WHEN file scanning operations run THEN the system SHALL measure and log processing speed (files per second)
3. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL track query execution times
4. WHEN the debug UI is accessed THEN the system SHALL display performance metrics and trends
